        <div><h2>Fluctuation in the Value of the won</h2></div>
        <div>1. **Fluctuation in the Value of the Won**:
             The South Korean won has experienced fluctuations due to several factors,
             including U.S. interest rate hikes, global economic uncertainty, and the aftermath
             of the COVID-19 pandemic. These fluctuations can significantly impact South Korea's export-driven economy.
             <p>2. **Strength of the U.S. Dollar**: The U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have led to a stronger
             dollar, which often results in a weaker won. This can increase the cost of imports for South Korea,
             affecting the trade balance.
             <p>3. **Bank of Korea's Response**: The Bank of Korea has been adjusting its
             monetary policy in response to exchange rate fluctuations. By raising interest rates, it aims to support
             the value of the won, curb inflation, and stabilize the foreign exchange market.
             <p>4. **Impact on Export and Import Businesses**: Exchange rate changes have significant implications for South
             Korean businesses. A weaker won can boost export competitiveness but also increase the cost of imported
             raw materials and energy. These topics are frequently covered in South Korean and international economic
             news, with a focus on the Korean government's and the Bank of Korea's policy responses. For the latest
             information, you might want to check major economic news websites or South Korean financial news outlets.
